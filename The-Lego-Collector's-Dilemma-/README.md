### Project Overview

 A die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as possible. But before that he/she wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that he/she can budget it from their revenue. Since (luckily!), he/she is a data scientist in the making, he/she wished to solve this problem themself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set etc. The aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have the better understanding of how to build a linear regression model. In this project, I applied following concepts,

- Train-test split

- Correlation between the features

- Linear Regression

- MSE and R^2 Evaluation Metrics


### Challenges faced

 - Started off with Data loading and splitting

- Second, found out the Correlation between Features and Target Variable

- Third, reduced feature redundancies. Specifically, the Features those were highly correlated with other Features and Target Variable

- Fourth, checked the model accuracy using Mean Squared Error and R2 score 

- Finally, checked the Residual and visualized errors
