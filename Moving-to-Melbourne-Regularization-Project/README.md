### Project Overview

 Our friend from Iowa, whose housing problem you solved, is now moving to Melbourne for a new assignment Down Under. As we have solved his Iowa housing problem so well, he wants us to solve his Melbourne housing problem too. Armed with your new found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent,price of the house, etc.




### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have the better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

- Train-test split

- Correlation between the features

- Linear Regression

- Polynomial Regressor

- Lasso Regressor

- Ridge Regressor

- R squared Evaluation Metrics


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 - Data Loading and Splitting

- Prediction Using Linear Regression

- Prediction Using Lasso

- Prediction using Ridge

- Prediction Using Cross Validation

- Prediction Using Polynomial Regressor
