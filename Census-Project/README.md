### Project Overview

 'CACT'(Census Analysis and Collection Team) wants someone to help with their census record management and data analysis with numpy programming skills. So, I was voluntarily in!  Nah! I had to complete it as part of course.. But I must say, it was really a lot of fun to work with census data. Now, I know, how government figure out things about their country. How cool is that!! 

I am glad, I applied my Numpy programming skills and learnt a lot about different concepts.


### Learnings from the project

- Array Appending
