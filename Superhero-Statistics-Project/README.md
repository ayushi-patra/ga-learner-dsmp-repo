### Project Overview

 The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. I have with me the data of more than 500 super humans which I will use with my knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, I have a better grip on the applications of descriptive statistics. In this project, I applied the following concepts:

- Bar plotting

- Boxplot plotting

- Pie-chart plotting

- Subplot operations

- Feature Correlation

- IQR operations
